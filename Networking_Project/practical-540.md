# Final Practical Exam

Using the diagram in the question section, you are to describe the process, "A day in the life of a packet." You will describe each step computer A in the Computer Science Network will take to get an IP address and successfully send a packet to netflix.com (in our network). Essentially you will be explaining a "WireShark" trace packet level of everything that must happen to make our example work.

## Assumptions

* Assume that Computer A is powered off when starting the exercise
* Assume that there are no entries in the ARP table
* Assume that 192.168.1.10 was the previous IP Address assigned to Computer A
* You can use any detail you want from the questions.md and or readme.md

## Questions

Though not limited to only these questions, here are some items to consider:

* Which protocol helps you learn about other computers on your Local Area Network?
* What are the steps to get an IP address?
* How is a packet routed?
* How is a webpage (netflix.com) requested?
* What is the sequence used to make an http request?

## Deliverable

You will take a screen recording of you explaining the process outline above, you can use the diagram and or a pointer to help, as long as your voice and face are shown.

This portion is worth 30 points.

* 5 Points for formatting, sharing link, and having the correct sharing permissions
* 5 Points for introducing yourself in the video and having the camera on
* 20 Points for correct sequencing information

You can make use of any screen capture technology you would like and render the capture as a MP4 or OGG/Vorbis equivalent. Use FaceTime, ClipChamp, Loom, or OBS. Upload it to your IIT Microsoft Drive or share the direct link, give permissions to share the video via link, and submit that shared link to Blackboard as the deliverable. Please test this.

### Screen Capture Tool Suggestion

If you haven't used any screen capture tools - I would recommend the [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/ "webpage for OBS Project"). The Open Broadcaster Software project is cross-platform and is a suite of tools used for screen capture and podcasting. I like it because there is a pretty straight forward record button and the recording is dumped instantly into an MP4. Facetime, ClipChamp, and Loom.com are good alternatives.
